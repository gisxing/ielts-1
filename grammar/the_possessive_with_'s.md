#The possessive with 's

## For people and sometimes animals, add 's for possession.

### Notes

* After a singular name or noun, the possessive is always __'s__:   
  _This is Sue__'s__ bag_.   
  _These are Sue__'s__ bags_.
  
* When the name is plural and ends in __s__, add __'__:   
  _My parents__'__ flat is quite small._   
  _The girls__'__ bedroom is upstairs._

* When the name is plural but does note end in __s__, add __'s__:
  _The children__'s__ coats are here._   
  _The men__'s__ toilets are closed._   
  _Emma and Paul__'s__ car is outside._
  
* We also use __'s__ with time words:   
  _A week__'s__ holiday, today__'s__ weather, yesterday__'s__ newspaper_
  
* And we use __s'__ with plural time words:   
  _Two weeks' holiday_ (>2 weeks)
